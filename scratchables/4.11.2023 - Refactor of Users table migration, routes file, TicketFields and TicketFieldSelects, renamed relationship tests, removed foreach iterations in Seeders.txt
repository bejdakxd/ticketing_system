Refactor ideas
- remove resolver and can change status columns in users table -- done
- refactor route web file -- done
- rename all relationship tests -- done
- foreach iterations in seeders can be shortened -- done
- factories for Mappable models should not be used at all -- done
- refactor ticket field select name variable to be setup on view, not on controller -- done
- delete render method from child ticketfieldselect components -- done
- synchronize fields in create view with edit fields view -- done
- make ticketfield and ticketfieldselect share the same code (ticketfieldselect could be child of ticketfield prehaps :) ) -- done
- rename TicketForm to TicketEditForm -- done
- group should be either in TicketConfig file, or all the other things like status, type etc should have separate files due to consistency -- done
- make actingAs and test in livewire test the same call chain -- done
- refactor permission seeder, I'm pretty sure we can create permission in one call -- done
- make TicketFieldSelectStatus share the isDisabled() funcionality with parent, add only additional funcionality, which is not mentioned in the parent method -- done
- transfer isDisabled() funcionality to Policy level -- done

- simplify attaching items to categories in tests - done
	- just assign all items to all categories in testseeder perhaps hmm hmm -- done
- check for setCategory, setItem and setDescription on policy level -- done
- remove isResolverFromSelectedGroup() method from TicketEditForm, IMO unnecessary, we can use Policy instead -- done
- make TicketCreateForm and TicketEditForm childs of TicketForm -- done
- make ticket-field-value and ticket-select views share the same styling -- done
