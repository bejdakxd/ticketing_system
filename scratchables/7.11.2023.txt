Refactor ideas:

- We should create more clear constants in TicketConfig, we should do smth like TicketConfig::STATUS_OPEN instead TicketConfig::STATUS['open'] -- done
- use test data providers -- done
- make tests for invalid fields in TicketEditForm -- done
- statusOnHoldReason should be IMO renamed, too many characters.. -- done
- refactor TicketObserver creating, too verbose call -- done
- instead of checking for status like "$ticket->status_id(TicketConfig::STATUSES['open'])" we should use model function isStatus() -- done
- delete unnecessary map factories -- cancelled, they are necessary
- onHold() state should also assign on hold reason -- cancelled, it does not make sense
- put addSpaceBeforeUppercase in TicketField class to some ServiceFile, or helper file.. -- done
- do the same for setDisplayName -- done
- make custom validation message instead of "The on hold reason field is blank when status is 3." -- done
- put into dataProviders also required_if tests -- done
- maybe we should make resolvers also part of all groups for tests -- done
- share the code "@if(!$hidden) <div class="space-y-1">" between ticket field and ticket field select components -- done
- make ticket-field and ticket-field-select as pure as possible -- cancelled, the names themselves imply they cannot be decoupled
- make count() method on models not duplicated on each of them.. -- done

Bugs:

- investigate, why when I modify TicketEditForm, and then I randomly click anywhere on TicketEditForm it resets to unwanted state, when field that should not show actually show.. -- done
