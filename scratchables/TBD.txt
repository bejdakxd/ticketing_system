Purpose of the project "ticket_system" is to demonstrate my programming abilities on potential job interviews.

19. Resolver dashboard
20. Statistics
21. Knowledge articles for common problems
22. Change templates
23. Subcategories
24. Watch list for tickets
25. Make TicketEditForm be synchronized in real time between browsers
26. Send e-mail, when Ticket SLA is before expiration

Use case problems:
- It should be possible to navigate to Tasks Taskable model from TaskEditForm -- done
- when a field is required, there should also be a red asterisk on the right of its label -- done
- SLA changes its duration even if model is archived -- done
- SLA bar does not spatially communicate, that it represents percentage before expiration, when on 100%,
- Priority 1 is shown even if user has no permission to set priority one
- when Status on EditForms is set to Open, resolved is not set to null
- tasks table does not have rounded corners
- breadcrumbs are missing
- empty Updated event rendered on TaskEditForm
- validation red error ring shown even after clicking on the field, it should hide
- rules() method on our Forms accept only arrays, we need to accept strings as well
- red asterisk not visible for fields without labels
- selects should be greyed out if they have no options

Refactor Ideas:
- change TicketTrait to separate traits
- TaskEditForm has to use an ugly looking conditional in forms() method, which puts Taskable in second position of EditForm, find a more flexible way
