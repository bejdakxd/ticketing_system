Refactor ideas:
- modify for example category.name field name to Category on pipe level
- adding new activity type to the system is cumbersome, too many places to manage.. (view, controller, permissions, policies)
- Category-Item pairing is disgusting.. please find a better solution -- done
- toIterable function can be replaced by making objects Iterable by themselves
- i noticed there is a lot of duplication on all EditForms so far.. investigate if it is possible to remove the duplication -- done
- find a way to share varaibles between livewire/blade components without specifying them (< :represented-model=$request /> for instance) -- done
- implement a universal EditForm, which will accept a Ticket model, and it'll render fields based on specification on Controller level -- done
- make Task model have a Morphs Taskable relationship instead of having Request relationship
- we should start using enums instead of mappable models due to further extensibility

Design ideas:
- make SLA bar always show at least a little bit of red color to indicate, that colors represent time left
- make tasks table have rounded corners on Tasks component
- breadcrumbs

Bugs:

- OnHoldReason validation error not audible if reason is empty
