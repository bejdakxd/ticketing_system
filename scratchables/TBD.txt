Use case problems:
- It should be possible to navigate to Tasks Taskable model from TaskEditForm -- done
- when a field is required, there should also be a red asterisk on the right of its label -- done
- SLA changes its duration even if model is archived -- done
- red asterisk not visible for fields without labels -- cancelled for now
- SLA bar does not spatially communicate, that it represents percentage before expiration, when on 100%, -- done
- when Status on EditForms is set to Open, resolved is not set to null -- done
- breadcrumbs are missing -- cancelled
- tasks table does not have rounded corners -- done
- empty Updated event rendered on TaskEditForm -- done
- validation red error ring shown even after clicking on the field, it should hide
- rules() method on our Forms accept only arrays, we need to accept strings as well
- selects should be greyed out if they have no options
- Priority 1 is shown even if user has no permission to set priority one
- SLA bar does not refresh on its own, you need to update EditForm
- created_at and update_at fields on EditForms show an ugly form of date and time
- Home index page shows only recent Incidents

Refactor Ideas:
- change TicketTrait to separate traits
- TaskEditForm has to use an ugly looking conditional in forms() method, which puts Taskable in second position of EditForm, find a more flexible way
