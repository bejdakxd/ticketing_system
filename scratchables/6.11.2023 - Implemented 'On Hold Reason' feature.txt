Purpose of the project "ticket_system" is to demonstrate my programming abilities on potential job interviews.

1. Resolved status archives ticket 3 days after resolving -- done
2. When ticket is in resolved status, no field other than status can be changed -- done
3. Refactor ticket field duplication (controller and view) -- done
4. Refactor entire code, so that we can have a good feeling from it -- done
5. Solve submit problem, nothing is currently being submitted - done
6. Dynamic field graying out -- done
7. Solve validation errors not displaying in fields -- done
8. Items -- done
9. Resolver group support -- done

10. On hold status needs reason - in progress

On hold status needs reason:

statusOnHoldReason

- Ticket belongsTo on hold reason -- done
- on hold reason hasMany Tickets -- done
- on hold reason name is uppercased and undersocres are replaced by spaces -- done
- database check for integrity with the selected status -- done
- controller check for required on hold reason if status is on hold -- done
- controller check for validation -- done
- wrap into permission -- done
- allow all resolvers to set on hold reason -- done
- hide on hold reason field, when status different than on hold -- done
- don't allow to submit EditForm if on hold reason empty and status on hold -- done
- show validation error when status is on hold and on hold status empty

20. Change templates
21. Subcategories

Refactor ideas:

- I think we should put TicketConfig into different locations, as the file starts to look nasty
- We should create more clear constants in TicketConfig, we should do smth like TicketConfig::STATUS_OPEN instead TicketConfig::STATUS['open']
- use test data providers
- reduce TicketTest unit test, move i.e. resolver tests into resolver test file
- statusOnHoldReason should be IMO renamed, too many characters..
- refactor TicketObserver creating, too verbose call
- instead of checking for status like "$ticket->status_id(TicketConfig::STATUSES['open'])" we should use model function isStatus()
- delete unnecessary map factories
- onHold() state should also assing on hold reason
- share the code <template x-data="{ hidden: @json($hideable) && @json($modifiable) }" x-if="!hidden"> between ticket field and ticket field select components
- put addSpaceBeforeUppercase in TicketField class to some ServiceFile, or helper file..
- do the same for setDisplayName, maybe you can even make the method pure
- make ticket-field and ticket-field-select as pure as possible
- make custom validation message instead of "The on hold reason field is blank when status is 3."

Bugs:

- investigate, why when I modify TicketEditForm, and then I randomly click anywhere on TicketEditForm it resets to unwanted state, when field that should not show actually show..
