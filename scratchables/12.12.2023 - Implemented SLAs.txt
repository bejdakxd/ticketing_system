Purpose of the project "ticket_system" is to demonstrate my programming abilities on potential job interviews.

1. Resolved status archives ticket 3 days after resolving -- done
2. When ticket is in resolved status, no field other than status can be changed -- done
3. Refactor ticket field duplication (controller and view) -- done
4. Refactor entire code, so that we can have a good feeling from it -- done
5. Solve submit problem, nothing is currently being submitted - done
6. Dynamic field graying out -- done
7. Solve validation errors not displaying in fields -- done
8. Items -- done
9. Resolver group support -- done
10. On hold status needs reason -- done
11. Priority 1 can be added only by user with the necessary permission -- done
12. Activities -- done

13. SLAs -- in progress


-- SLA-s in our contract already exist, we are just trying to implement funcionalities, which will effectively notify resolver about remaining time until SLA expires

- SLA belongsTo SLAble -- done
- Ticket is SLAble -- done
- Ticket hasMany SLAs -- done
- on Ticket creation SLA is assigned based on priority -- done
- on each priority change SLA resets -- done
- on priority change a reason needs to be added -- done
- P4 has 24h -- done
- P3 has 12h -- done
- P2 has 2h -- done
- P1 has 30m -- done
- SLA state will be viewable in similar fashion as other fields -- done
- SLA closes itself if a new SLA for same Slable model gets created -- done

14. Implement multiple tasks support for requests
15. E-mail notification on ticket update
16. Watch list for tickets
17. Statistics
18. Resolver dashboard
19. Knowledge articles for common problems
20. Change templates
21. Subcategories
22. Resolver required_if Status in_progress
23. Make TicketEditForm be synchronized in real time between browsers
24. Send e-mail, when Ticket SLA is before expiration

Refactor ideas:
- modify for example category.name field name to Category on pipe level
- adding new activity type to the system is cumbersome, too many places to manage.. (view, controller, permissions, policies)

Bugs:

- OnHoldReason validation error not audible if reason is empty
